    Description {
        gamified creative coding/hacking challenges refining craft

        Coders program themed coding styles ascending creativity
        ultimately accelerating productivity meeting deadlines early,
        mitigating bugs, recruiting, and most importantly building community.

        Coders write the same program in various constrained
        styles stimulating creativity.
        Constrainted styles: limiting operators, lines of code, data types used,
        racing against the clock, etc.

Challenge Mindset
File inidicator definitions

    Mindset -> Product Development Stages
    - <filename>.quick_and_dirty.<exe> : proof of concept code, chaotic, low reusable
    - <filename>.engineered     .<exe> : reusable, architected, easily improvable, non chaotic
    - <filename>.optimized      .<exe> : high performant specialized invention, low reusable

     Mindset -> IO CRUNCHING
    - <filename>.min_code       .<exe> : least lines of  code challenge
    - <filename>.min_ops        .<exe> : restricted operators/func
    - <filename>.min_type       .<exe> : restricted datatypes
    - <filename>.min_memsize    .<exe> : restricted memory size
    - <filename>.min_memdecs    .<exe> : restricted memory declarations

Program Size Classification

    - basic :   datatype builtin methods, evenOdd, perceivable straightforward requirements
    - script:   tic-tac-toe, minesweeper, "simple" games
    - project:  expect to sleep on it
